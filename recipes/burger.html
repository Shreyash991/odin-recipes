    <p>
        We've made these a few times now and the kids love it every time," shares home cook Christel K. "Despite the basic ingredients list it's an absolutely delicious burger, especially when dressed up with some toppings! We add spinach, old cheddar cheese, onions, pickles, plus mustard and mayo

        Followed the recipe closely — good hamburgers," says dwolk. "One note of which to be aware: The recipe calls for 6-8 minutes a side! My ordinary outdoor propane three-burner grill: 3-4 a side and more than medium-rare.
