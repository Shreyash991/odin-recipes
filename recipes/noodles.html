        By the way, that's our little secret, since I'm fine with the general public thinking it was simply a stroke of recipe development genius. The other, intentional stroke of recipe development genius was using bucatini for the noodles. Any pasta or other noddle would work just fine here, but the hollow spaghetti did a wonderful job of sucking up all that lovely sauce, and I loved the final texture of the dish.

        You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about ⅓-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.
